Suppose `G` is a finite group, and there are positive integers `r` and `s`
with `r` even and `s` odd, such that `Hʳ(S,M) ≅ Hˢ(S,M) ≅ 0` for all subgroup `S` of `G`.
Then we prove that `M` has trivial cohomology.
This is used in proving that `split σ` has trivial cohomology, where `σ` is a fundamental class
in a finite class formation.

The theorem is proved first for solvable groups, by induction on the subgroup
using inflation-restriction.
The proof in the general case requires the corestriction map `Cor : Hⁿ(H,M) ⟶ Hⁿ(G,M)`.

As a corollary, we show that if `M` has trivial cohomology then `up.obj M` and `down.obj M`
both have trivial cohomology. Using this, we show that if `M` has trivial cohomology then it has
trivial Tate cohomology.

  This is proved by induction on `H`.
  If `H` is the trivial subgroup then the result is true.
  Assume that the result is true for every proper subgroup of `H`, and choose a
  normal subgroup `K` of `H` such that `H ⧸ K` is cyclic. We are therefore assuming
  that the restriction of `M` to `K` is acyclic.

  Since `M` is `K`-acyclic, we have for every `r > 0` an inflation-restriction sequence:

    `0 ⟶ Hʳ(H/K,Mᴷ) ⟶ Hʳ(H,M) ⟶ Hʳ(K,M)`.

  as the last term is zero, we have isomorphisms `Hʳ(H/K,Mᴷ) ≅ Hʳ(H,M)` for all `r > 0`.
  In particular `H²ⁿ⁺²(H/K,Mᴷ)` and `H²ᵐ⁺¹(H/K,Mᴷ)` are both zero.
  By the periodicity of the cohomology of a cyclic group, `Hʳ(H/K,Mᴷ)` is zero for all `r > 0`.
  Therefore `Hʳ(H,M)=0` for all `r > 0`.

  Let `p` be any prime number and let `S` be a subgroup of `G`.
  The group `Hⁿ(S,M)[p^∞]` is isomorphic to a subgroup of `Hⁿ(Sₚ,M)` where
  `Sₚ` is a Sylow `p`-subgroup of `S`.
  Since `p`-groups are solvable, the previous theorem implies that `Hⁿ(Sₚ,M) ≅ 0`.
  This shows that `Hⁿ(S,M)` has no elements of finite order.
  Since `n > 0`, the cohomology groups are torsion.
